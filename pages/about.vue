    <h1>Hire Me</h1>

    <p>I'm Macguire: an experience designer, full-stack web developer, hackathon participant, music producer, and Interactive Arts & Technology undergraduate at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, BC. I would love to work for a large tech company, or a small startup doing either design or development, as I have a passion for both.</p>

    <p>When I'm not studying or learning a new web framework, you can catch me DJing, making my own beats, editing travel videos, or hiking the Swiss Alps with my mom.</p>
