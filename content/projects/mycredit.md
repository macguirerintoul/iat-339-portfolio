A mobile app for Vancity members to understand and build credit, in order to better support their financial well-being. The four-week project is a hypothetical product for Vancity, and is not affiliated with the brand.

## My Contribution

As the project manager, I ensured that the project's individual parts were being completed and were cohesive, and decided when to stop iterating and start polishing. As the content strategist, I wrote copy that was consistent with our three design principles: personal, clear, and hopeful. I also ensured that the credit-related content in MyCredit was beneficial and easy to understand, which I validated by conducting interviews and think-aloud testing with 9 participants.

## Problem

Despite the importance of credit scores in personal finance, an estimated 56% of Canadians have never checked their credit score and 31% don't know how to improve their score.

> "With 250,000 of them – close to half of our members – interacting with us almost entirely online or via our mobile app, we’re under pressure to deliver even more mobile and digital functionality." — Vancity 2017 Annual Report

Vancity's current website offers some credit help, but it lies 4 levels deep in navigation. Furthermore, their existing banking app has yet to provide resources for credit management.

## Solution

MyCredit is a companion app for Vancity members to manage their credit and set goals that encourage credit building, to better support their financial well-being.
